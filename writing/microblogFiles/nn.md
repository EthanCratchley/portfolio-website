Anybody who's worked in ML or AI knows how important high-quality, clean data is for training a good model. These days, a lot of people throw around the word *"neural network"* today in regards to AI and LLMs, but what you may not know is that this model architecture is actually based on the human brain and **its own neural network.** 

In this post, I am going to explore some of the differences between an artificial neural network (ANN) and the biological neural network (NN) we all have in our heads. I won't go into too much technical detail, but rather the importance of high quality data not just for ANNs but also and more importantly for our own neural nets.

# The Science - Brain vs ANN

A neural network, in the context of AI, is a type of deep learning model made up of layers of connected **nodes** often called **artificial neurons**. These nodes are loosely inspired by the structure of the human brain. Information flows through the network, and each connection has a weight that determines how important that signal is. During training, these **weights** are adjusted based on feedback to help the model make better predictions over time.

This process is known as **backpropagation**, and it’s basically the machine’s version of learning from its mistakes.

Your brain is made up of around **86 billion neurons**, which send electrical signals to each other through connections called **synapses**. Every time you learn something, experience something, etc. these connections either strengthen or weaken. This process is called **neuroplasticity**.

**The main takeaway:**
```go
Both systems (artificial and biological) learn by adjusting internal connections in response to data
```

## Hallucinations: The Brain and the Model
Just like LLMs sometimes “hallucinate” confidently generating false or made-up information, our brains do the same.

- We misremember things
- We dream vivid stories that never happened
- We believe false information if it’s repeated enough
```go
The brain doesn’t always distinguish clearly between truth and well-reinforced patterns.
```

This is why misinformation, trauma, and even repeated negative self-talk can rewire your brain in harmful ways. The input becomes real to the model, even if it isn’t true.

## Learning as a Child vs Adult
Children learn incredibly fast, and part of that is because their brains are more plastic. Neural connections are forming rapidly, and they’re absorbing data constantly, without as much filtering.

In a way, it’s like training a fresh LLM from scratch:
- Every input counts
- There’s no strong prior model, so every experience becomes part of the foundational structure

As adults, we already have a pre-trained model which means new information tends to be interpreted through existing weights. Learning still happens, but often slower, and it may take deliberate effort to override previous patterns.
```go
Which is why "fixing your inputs" is even more important as you get older, you’re not buiilding your foundational model anymore but instead fine-tuning
```

# What are the Inputs?

In AI, that data might be images, text, sound, etc. but for your brain the *"data"* is your daily lived experiences:
- What you see
- What you hear
- What you read
- Who you talk to 
- The environment you're in

These inputs shape the weights of an ANN or in our case they shape our beliefs, habits, reactions, and more.

So while ANNs are a simplified abstraction of the brain, the core idea is the same: you are a model being trained by your inputs. Just like an ANN needs clean relevant data to learn well, you need high-quality inputs if you want to think clearly, make good decisions, and grow.

## What can you do about your Inputs?
- Clean up your inputs:
  - Be intentional with the media you consume — your brain is watching even when you’re not paying attention.
  - Prioritize signal over noise: high-quality, educational, or thought-provoking content as opposed to mind numbing scrolling and void posting

It’s not about cutting out fun or only reading dense textbooks. But you need to be intentional with what you consume and how you consume it. Some people say watching movies is a waste of time, some are but I don't think so. Some of the greatest ideas were inspired by the entertainment industry. You can learn a lot from film, music, games, or even casual conversation if you’re paying attention.

Original ideas don’t just appear out of nowhere (they hardly exist at all), they’re often combinations of past influences. And because that's the case you might as well make sure your media is of high quality!

# Closing Thoughts 
At the end of the day, you are a neural network. One that’s been training since the moment you were born.

Like any model, the outputs you produce: your thoughts, beliefs, decisions, and habits are shaped by the inputs you receive and the feedback you internalize. Your environment, the media you consume, the people you spend time with, all of it acts as training data.

Artificial neural networks are built to learn and adapt. So are you.

The difference is: you get to choose your data.

The bottom line is whether you’re training an ANN or just trying to improve your own life, the principle stays the same:

**Your outputs will only ever be as good as your inputs.**
