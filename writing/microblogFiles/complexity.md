Complexity is a disease, it has infected the many minds and industries of our world today.

**People are always looking for what to add to their life**. Often what they should be looking for is the opposite; **"What should I remove from my life?"**

# Why do we have complexity?

Complexity can be brought upon by ourselves or it can be forced upon us.

**Selfmade Complexity:** You want to learn to code, You would think that the process looks something like:

1. What do you want to code?
2. What do you need to code it?
3. How can you code it as efficiently as possible?

</br>

_Instead the process for many ends up looking something like:_

1. How can I be most productive in learning programming?
2. What are the best tools for productivity?
3. What are the best programming courses?
4. What are the best programming books?
5. How do I establish a plan to learn programming?
6. What should I do before I start programming?
7. What is the best tech stack?
8. ...

This could go on quite literally forever, eventually you will have done nothing, learned nothing, and managed to waste your time while still feeling productive.

You could argue this is an issue of procrastination but I don't think so. Often when people do this it is not because they are to lazy to start but rather because they are confused or overwhelmed. They hear professionals talk about these things and feel that they need to integrate them before they can get started.

# Structural Complexities:

The latter can be seen in many places today. For example education, the process of signing up for classes and switching between faculties has a lot of friction.

You will find yourself in a situation where you want to sign up for an interesting class but it has very strange requirements that are almost completely unrelated from the class and don't really benefit you in any way. We have to ask ourselves **"Would the world and education system be a better place with or without many of these requirements?"** often _less is more._

We want our children to move fast, learn fast, enter the workplace and help civilization continue to move forward. But as a society we are doing nothing but slowing them down with the friction constantly forced upon them.

I don't believe that this is being bestowed upon our society with some evil intent or that universities wish the worst for their students, but this is a sturctural problem due to unaligned incentives, an outdated education system, and deep beauracy.

# How do we get rid of Complexity?

Getting rid of complexity is not hard. We need to approach every addition to our lives, companies, systems with caution. Add based on necessity, or even better when you think you need to add something, try and come up with a solution first.

## Excess notes and examples on Complexity

When you want to be **productive** don't watch a video on how to do so, or download an app to help you. When you want to **start a company** don't look to hire a bunch of people and add a bunch of things. Once you are **rich** don't buy a bunch of stupid expensive cars, clothes, etc. focus on your product and the future.

All these things are complexities and clutter. They are exactly what is going to keep you from doing the exact thing you set out to do.

During a startup you are constantly on the brink of failure. Your goal is two things:

1. Cashflow
2. Product Development

Not the other endless fun things you can look to spend money on with your new found company.

---

The bottom line is that if you don't cut out complexity from your life, business, programming, etc. you are going to get burnt and left behind by competitors. Because while your energy/capital is being deployed all over the place, others will be going all in on one thing and blow right past you.
