You are a ball of experiences, values, motivation, emotions, etc. constantly heading towards a decision. 

Even when you stop and think about what decision you are about to make, it has largely already been determined. In other words you are a slave to cause and effect.

What do I mean by this?

Well, by definition cause and effect is the direct relationship between an action (cause) and its consequence (effect). For example, if I offer you a free trip to go sky diving, you might think about this for a long time or you might know the answer right away. But this isn‚Äôt about consciously weighing options in the moment. Rather, it‚Äôs about uncovering the decision your brain has already made, informed by predictive coding, the brain‚Äôs mechanism for using past experiences to anticipate and simplify decision making. This conclusion is shaped by the intricate web of influences (your big ball) that have molded you throughout your life.

So in any case when faced with a decision, your brain will naturally arrive at what it perceives as the most rational conclusion. This process is guided by the deeply ingrained patterns of cause and effect that have defined your personal experiences and shaped your identity.

As you get older, this web gets stronger and stronger. Consequently, your decisions become more and more predictable. This is due to the brain‚Äôs drive for neuroefficiency, which conserves energy by reinforcing habits, which rewards familiar and routine behaviors. The brain engages different regions, such as the default mode network for routine decisions, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for more deliberate, complex choices. However, even in complex decisions, these regions rely heavily on ingrained neural patterns.

In the simplest terms, think of it like a math equation: when x+y=z, the outcome (ùëß) will always depend on the inputs (ùë• and y). Similarly, as the web of your experiences and influences evolves, the decisions you make will shift accordingly. This brings us back to the idea that your decisions are ultimately dictated by your inputs. 

The bottom line is if you want to make the 'right' decisions in life, you need to focus on reshaping the inputs that form your web and not leaving it up to your willpower and discipline to make the right decision, because you will almost always let yourself down due to your poorly made web!

*Side Note: people love to talk about discipline, hard work, etc. but it simply doesn't work for almost anyone and will lead to less consistent results. Even people like David Goggins, who seemingly can do anything with just some good discipline in reality have just built a strong web to make it easy to make the right decision.*

Remember, **when one card falls, the entire house of cards collapses.**
