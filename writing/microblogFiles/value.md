# Gamestop Saga

Before Gamestop was one of the biggest stocks on Wall St it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Billions of dollars in short positions were being held by some of the biggest hedge funds and money managers in the world. 

In fact GME had short interest of over 100% at its peak! This meant that for every share outstanding there was a short position on top of that as well as shorts positions on top of short positions!

Keith Gill aka Roaring Kitty aka DeepFuckingValue held GME for months before he saw any returns, in fact he was losing quite a bit of money!  When Keith talks about his investing formula he mentions ([Link]) "Even if you can get an accurate value for a stock, the market doesn't care and often nobody gives a shit." 

The idea that although you may have uncovered value and you may be correct is great! But that really doesn't matter if nobody agrees with you or nobody cares. This is because what shifts the value of a stock is not just the intrinsic value of a company but more importantly the sentiment of the company. 

I understand that everything is priced in, but the idea that **Intrinsic Value = Price** is false. The reality is that the value lies in the eyes of the market and even more then that, the value lies in how many people agree with that valuation. As we saw with both the unreasonable valuation of GME when it was skyrocketing in price as well as when it was being shorted to death.

# 2008 Financial Crisis

Perhaps an even better example of this is Michael Burry and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Burry began his short position against the housing market around 2005 and the market did not peek until near the end of 2007. This means that Burry had to wait nearly 3 years before his investment showed any returns.

Burry had thousands of investors money on the line and was down over 20% on his investment while burning the last of the funds money to pay back his short position to the banks. Scion Capital was not far from failure and a margin call despite his assessment of the intrinsic value of the market being correct multiple years ago, proving once again that value is only one piece of the puzzle.

# What can we learn from this?

If there is anything I would take away from this it is that your opinion on the valuation of a company (or your opinion on anything really) doesn't really matter if nobody knows/cares/agrees. 

Knowing this it doesn't mean we should go around shilling stocks or beliefs to people. But it also does not mean that you should give up on your opinion and beliefs. Instead it means that before making a decision or investment we need to take into account the market sentiment as a qualitative piece of data to consider.

I'll leave you with a quote from Winston Churchill, *"History is written by the victors."*
