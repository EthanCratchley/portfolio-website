# Gamestop Saga

Before Gamestop was one of the biggest stocks on Wall St. it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Billions of dollars in short positions were being held by some of the biggest hedge funds and money managers in the world.

In fact GME had short interest of over 100% at its peak! This meant that for every share outstanding there was a short position and many of these short positions had another short position on top of it!

Keith Gill aka Roaring Kitty aka DeepFuckingValue held GME for months before he saw any returns, in fact he was losing quite a bit of money! When Keith talks about his investing formula he mentions ([Link]) "Even if you can get an accurate value for a stock, the market doesn't care and often nobody gives a shit."

The idea that although you may have uncovered value and you may be correct is great! But that really doesn't matter if nobody agrees with you or nobody cares. This is because what shifts the value of a stock is not just the intrinsic value of a company but the sentiment & story of the company.

People often say “everything is priced in,” but the idea that intrinsic value = price is simply false. Value exists in the eyes of the market, and more specifically, in the level of collective agreement around that valuation. We saw this clearly with GameStop both when it was being shorted into oblivion, and when it was priced at levels that made no fundamental sense at all.

# 2008 Financial Crisis

Perhaps an even better example of this is Michael Burry and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Burry began his short position against the housing market around 2005 and the market did not peak until near the end of 2007. This means that Burry had to wait almost 3 years before his investment showed any returns.

Burry had thousands of investors money on the line and was down over 20% on his investment while burning the last of the funds capital to pay back his short position to the banks. Scion Capital was not far from failure and a margin call despite his assessment of the intrinsic value on the market being correct multiple years ago, proving once again that value is only one piece of the puzzle.

# What can we learn from this?

If there’s one takeaway, it’s this it is that your opinion on the value of a company (or really, your opinion on anything) doesn’t matter much if nobody knows, cares, or agrees.

That doesn’t mean we should go around shilling stocks or forcing beliefs onto others. But it also doesn’t mean abandoning conviction. It means recognizing that sentiment and coordination are real forces, and they matter.

The point I am trying to get across can be summarized as follows: "In the short term, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term, it's a weighing machine."
