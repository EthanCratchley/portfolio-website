Humans are obsessed with milestones. We all have specific days throughout the year that we celebrate or treat as important.

People make wishes at 11:11. We stare at the clock as it counts down to the New Year. We make resolutions that, for some reason, we can only start once the calendar flips.

Personally, I’ve found date and time to be more of a distraction than anything else. Have you ever caught yourself staring at the clock thinking, “I’ll get up and do X at Y time”? I know I have. And if I had just gotten up right away all those times, I’d probably be a lot more productive.

Many species follow patterns like circadian rhythms and seasonal behaviors but no other species follows them so ritualistically. That makes me wonder: is this a strength or a weakness? Does it help us stay organized, or does it quietly chip away at productivity and even happiness?

I’m not arguing that we should get rid of dates and time altogether. That would cause more problems than it would solve. But rather that we should value each minute more carefully — spend less time watching the clock, and more time actually doing.
