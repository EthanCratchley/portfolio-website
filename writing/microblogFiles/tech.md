Some argue that technology carries embedded values and is therefore not neutral, others argue that technology is inherently neutral. “Guns Don’t Kill, People Kill”; Values in and/or Around Technologies by Joseph C. Pitt lays the foundation for what comes to be known as The Value-Neutrality Thesis (VNT). This is the argument that technologies do not have, have embedded in them, or contain any values at all. He claims that moral evaluation only applies to how humans use technology, not the technology itself. This conclusion shifts the responsibility from the designers, inventors, builders and technology itself into the hands of individual users. 

The importance of such a conclusion couldn’t be more relevant than it is today. To have a foundational framework of what the philosophy behind technologies today like artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and more is key to building the necessary laws, regulation, and guidelines for using and building these tools. If technology is neutral, laws and regulations should focus on use rather than the artifacts themselves.

Pitt breaks down the argument for value neutrality in four main points. First, he emphasizes that values are human motivators rather than properties of artifacts. By definition, a value involves a preference for certain states of affairs that guide action, but technologies have no intentions or motivations of their own. Second, he challenges the idea that artifacts can contain inherent values by asking where precisely such values would be located. For example, if one claims that a bridge is “racist”, what part of the bridge contains this property? At best you may be able to argue the designer’s values when making it, but the artifact itself is simply just earth or material. Third and also the crux of his argument is that responsibility lies with people, not machines. If a brake fails either the user neglected maintenance or the manufacturer made an error, to blame the machine itself is absurd. Finally, Pitt disputes the ideological critiques claiming that all technology embodies some value such as capitalism, racism, or others and states that they are often unfalsifiable conspiracy theories. For example, Langdon Winner's claim from “Do Artifacts Have Politics” about Robert Moses bridges is historically disputed and even if true, the value lies with Moses, not the overpass.

At its core artifacts are a means, not ends and Pitt makes this clear. Artifacts are versatile and can be used for various purposes which shows they do not contain any inherent moral direction. A kitchen knife, for example, can prepare food or harm someone, the tool itself does not dictate which outcome occurs. Pitt presents the question of why someone would oppose the idea that technologies are value neutral, he concludes that they do this to escape responsibility for their own actions. Pitt’s claims consistently remind us that even the most advanced technologies are instruments, and it is human choices that ultimately carry moral weight.
