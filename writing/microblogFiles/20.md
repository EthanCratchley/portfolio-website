- Learn how finance works
- Train as much as you can in whatever field you're in while you have the time
- Don't fall for political theater
- Don't underestimate how fast time goes
- “Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing”
- Your fluid intelligence peaks in your mid 20s, execute while you can, acquire insights, carry them into future decades, study non-fiction, increase pattern recognition
- Find what you’re good at and enjoy and do that
- Figure out your weakness and outsource it
