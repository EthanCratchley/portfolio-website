**On my 20th birthday (07/17/2024) I asked X/Twitter to give me advice for the next decade. Below is a list of them all.**

- Happiness comes from discipline, achievement and hard work - not short term gratification
- Learn how finance works
- Train as much as you can in whatever field you're in while you have the time
- Don't fall for political theater
- Don't underestimate how fast time goes
- “Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing”
- Your fluid intelligence peaks in your mid 20s, execute while you can, acquire insights, carry them into future decades, study non-fiction, increase pattern recognition
- Find what you’re good at and enjoy and do that
- Figure out your weakness and outsource it
- Hang around winners and positive people who make you happy
- Prioritize physical and mental health
- You control how you feel

- Work hard, play hard
- Love easily and forgive as much as you can
- Sign contracts, even with friends
- Travel for extended periods of times in strange places
- Use your high T and recovery to maximize gym gains and get a good cardio base (I suggest strength training if you don't already do)
- Pay attention to your nutrition
- Try to get better every day, and learn a few skills. The road is long, and you have some time to do a lot of exploring. No rush, as long as you lay a brick every single day
- The friends you have now will probably not be the ones you will have in a decade, no matter how close you are
- Prioritize what you think is right over what people/culture are telling you to think
- Surround yourself with people that push you to become better, as well as ambitious people
- Do take some time to enjoy your youth and be a fucking idiot, it's important
- Don't let a woman into your life for a long-term relationship too early (unless she is a really good one, but it is hard to assess when you are young)
- Learn from your mistakes
- Be impatient with action, but patient with results: you will not see the results of your hard work for years
- Don't let your ego get in the way

- Don’t die
- Take your time
- When it's done, let it be done
