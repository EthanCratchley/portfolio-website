# Abstract
I will be exploring the most consistent and accurate indicator (or combination of indicators) for predicting recessions over the past ~200 years. I will be using data and statistical analysis to come to a conclusion. This indicator will not be location specific and will be tested and researched based on recessions from around the world. I will be using multiple forms of statistical analysis for each indicator and comparing them against eachother as opposed to using one form of analysis for all indicators.
