Complexity is a disease, it has infected the many minds and industries of our world today.

**People are always looking for what to add to their life**. Often what they should be looking for is the opposite. That being, **"What should I remove from my life?"**

This is a result of the complexity that fills our mind in todays society. It is not always obvious when it is happening and I myself am a victim of this. So we need to ask ourselves, Why do we have complexity? How do we get rid of it?

### Why do we have complexity?

Complexity can be either broughout upon by ourselves or it can be forced upon us.

#### Selfmade Complexity: You want to learn to code, You would think that the process looks something like:

1. What do you want to code?
2. What do you need to code it?
3. How can you code it as efficently as possible?

#### <br> Instead the process for many ends up looking something like:

1. How can I be most productive in learning programming?
2. What are the best tools for productivity?
3. What are the best programming courses?
4. What are the best programming books?
5. How do I establish a plan to learn programming?
6. What should I do before I start programming?
7. What is the best tech stack?
8. ...

This could go on quite literally forever, eventually you will have done nothing, learned nothing, and managed to waste your time while feeling productive. 

You could argue this is an issue of procrastination but I would say that it is actually more of a byproduct of complexity. Often when people do these things it is not because they are to lazy to start but rather because they are confused and overwhelmed. They hear profesionals talk about so many different things and feel that they need to integrate them all to be most efficent.

### Societies Complexities:

The latter can be seen in many places today. For example education, the process of signing up for classes and swicthing between faculty's has a lot of friction. 

You will find yourself in a situation where you want to sign up for a interesting class but it has very strange requirements that are almost completely unrelated from the class and don't really benefit you in anyway. We have to ask ourselves **"Would the world and education system be a better place with or without many of these requirements?"** often *less is more.*

We want our children and the people of the future to move fast and learn fast to help our civilization continue to move forward, as well as begin to start building capital in the expensive world we live in today. But as a society we are doing nothing but slowing them down with the friction constantly forced upon their lives.

I don't believe that this is being bestowed upon our society with some evil intent or that universities wish the worst for their students, but I do believe this is a common mistake being made today.

### How do we get rid of Complexity?

Luckily getting rid of complexity is not as hard as it may seem. Elon Musk has been in a huge advocate for First Principles Thinking. This idea stems from physics where you go back to the first laws of physics and move up from there when you encounter an error, problem, idea, etc. If we could apply this way of thinking to our many complex environments in the world today, just think about how much better of a society we could be.

#### Applying First Principles Thinking:
1. Identify Core Components
2. Understand the Funamental Logic/Sciences Involved
3. Challenge Assumptions
4. Reduce Components 
5. Apply Principles

## Excess notes and examples on Complexity 

When you want to be **productive** don't watch a video on how to do so, or download an app to help you. When you want to **start a company** don't look to hire a bunch of people and add a bunch of things. Once you are **rich** don't buy a bunch of stupid expensive cars, clothes, etc. focus on your product and the future. 

All these things are complexities and clutter. They are exactly what is going to keep you from doing the exact thing you set out to do.  

<br>
During a startup you are constantly on the brink of failure. Your goal is two things:

1. Cashflow
2. Product Development   

<br>

Not the other endless fun things you can look to spend money on with your new found company.
   
<br>

The bottom line is that if you don't cut out complexity from your life, business, programming, etc. you are going to get burnt and left behind by competitors. Because while your energy/capital is being deployed all over the place, others will be going all in on one thing and blow right past you.
