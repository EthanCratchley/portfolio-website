# Question
Are we entering a new age of consumer products and marketing where we will see products built around a pre-established brand? 


# Observations
When you look at some of the most succesful consumer products of the past couple years some that come to mind are Feastables, MrBeast Burgers, Prime, Skims, Yeezy, almost every makeup and skin care brand, and many more.

These companies all have valuations of over $100M and many even have over $1B valuations, not to mention the fact that they found this level of success in just a couple years.

Many of these products are not fundamentally different or better than their competitors but despite having less staff, less money, and less time they have found their way to the top of their respective industries.
