# Question
Are we entering a new age of consumer products and marketing where we will see products built around a pre-established brand? 

# Observations
When you look at some of the most succesful consumer products of the past couple years some that come to mind are Feastables, MrBeast Burgers, Prime, Skims, Yeezy, almost every makeup and skin care brand, and many more.

These companies all have valuations of over $100M and many even have over $1B valuations, not to mention the fact that they found this level of success in just a couple years.

These products are not fundamentally different or better than their competitors but despite having fewer resources they have found their way to the top of their respective industries. This success is largely due to the strong personal brands behind them.

Knowing this information I would be pretty confident in saying that it is very unlikely these products would have seen the same success without being able to put a face to the product.

All this money that they are making is not a result of a new untapped market but rather just market share being taken from legacy brands in the b2c market.

# Future 
Marc Andreessen talks about a possible "great transition" in branding.

He states “more aggressive argument that could be made—which is kind of where I am—is maybe the influencer/creator-branded, kind of individually-branded things, this might be the future of consumer products generally”.

I tend to agree with Marc, people resonate much more with the perception of a product and who it is identified with.

Things aren't how they used to be where everyone just sat around and watched the same thing on TV, today we have algorithms that choose specifcally what to show you. Brands can no longer just slap a famous person in their videos or a catchy song to sell you their products. People want to feel a connection to the company.

So how can pre-established brands or company's that don't have a celebrity to be the face of their company adjust?

I don't expect to see legacy brands begin to lose significant market share for at least another 20-30 years. Regardless if they do want to survive the next wave I would reccomend to them to shift their marketing/branding to a company that can easily benefit from social media and trends (a great example of this right now would be Stanley). 

Option number two is to lean into the trend and hire a big name to be the face of a specifc product or even the whole company. 

This is not a problem with a simple solution, regardless if you a startup or a legacy brand competing against this new age of companies will definetly be a struggle. 

# Questions
- Will this trend break into tech?
- Are we correct in assuming a majority of companies will be built around the a celebrity?
- How can smaller companies leverage this trend without having access to big-name celebrities?
- What are the potential risks for companies heavily reliant on a single personal brand for their success?
- How might this trend affect pricing?
- If too many companies follow this trend will consumers lose interest?
