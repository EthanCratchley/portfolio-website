# Gamestop Saga

Before Gamestop was one of the biggest stocks on Wall St it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Billions of dollars in short positions were being held by some of the biggest hedge funds and money managers in the world. 

In fact GME had short interest of over 100% at its peak! This meant that for every share oustanding there was a short position on top of that as well as shorts positions ontop of short positions!

Keith Gill aka Roraring Kitty aka DeepFuckingValue held GME for months before he saw any returns. When Keith talks about his investing formula he mentions ([Link]) "Even if you can get an accurate value for a stock, the market doens't care and often nobody gives a shit." 

The idea that although you may have uncovered value and you may be correct is great! But that really doesn't matter if nobody agrees with you or nobody cares. This is because what shifts the value of a stock is not just the intrinsic value of a company but more importantly the sentiment of the company. 

This idea that **Value = Price** is false (unless perhaps on a term of 3-5 years+)! The reality is that the value lies in the eyes of the market and even more then that, the value lies in how the market determines value. As we saw with both unreasonable value of GME when it was skyrocketing in value as well as when it was being shorted to death.

# 2008 Financial Crisis

Perhaps an even better example of this is Micheal Burry and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Burry began his short position against the housing market around 2005 and the market did not peek until near the end of 2007. This means that burry had to wait nearly 3 years before his investment showed any returns.

Burry had thousands of investors money on the line and was down over 20% on his investment while burning the last of the company's money to pay back his short position to the banks. Scion Capital was not far from failure and a margin call despite his assesment of the intrinsic value of the market being correct multiple years ago.
