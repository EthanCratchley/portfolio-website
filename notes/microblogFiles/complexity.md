Complexity is a disease, it has infected the many minds and inustries of our world today.

**People are always looking for what to add to their life**. Often what they should be looking for is the oposite. That being, **"What should I remove from my life?"**

### For example, you want to learn to program. You would think that the process looks something like:

1. What do you want to code?
2. What do you need to code it?
3. How can you code it as efficently as possible?

### <br> Instead the process for many ends up looking somethging like:

1. How can I be most productive in learning programming?
2. What are the best tools for productivity?
3. What are the best programming courses?
4. What are the best programming books?
5. How do I establish a plan to learn programming?
6. What should I do before I start programming?
7. What is the best tech stack?
8. ...

This could go on quite literally forever, eventually you will have done nothing, learned nothing, and managed to waste your time while feeling productive.

This is a result of the complexity that fills our mind in todays society. It is not always entire obvious when it is happening and I myself am a victim of this. So we need to ask ourselves, Why do we have complexity? How do we get rid of it?

### Why do we have complexity?

Complexity can be either broughout upon by ourselves or it can be forced upon us. The example I gave earlier is the first. The latter can be seen in many places today. For example education, the process of signing up for classes and swicthing between faculty's has a lot of friction. 

You will find yourself in a situation where you want to sign up for a interesting class has very strange requirements that are almost completely unrelated from the class and don't really benefit you in anyway. We have to ask ourselves **"Would the world and education system be a better place with or without many of these requirements?"** often *less is more.*

We want our children and the people of the future to move fast and learn fast to help our civilization continue to move forward. But as a society we are doing nothing but slowing them down with the friction constantly forced upon their lives.

I don't believe that this is being bestowed upon our society with some evil intent or that universities wish the worst for their students, but I do believe this is a common mistake being made today.

### How do we get rid of Complexity?

Luckily getting rid of complexity is not as hard as it may seem.
